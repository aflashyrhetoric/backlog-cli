# To Do

## Priorities
- [ ] Create LinkBuilders for PR/Notification
- [ ] Create Repository struct and refactor OOP-style
- [ ] Interactive `blg init` to initialize configuration
- [ ] Review public/private functions and variables and do consistency pass in capitalization and naming convention

## Main List 
- [ ] Clean up emoji handling in strings 
- [ ] Update Endpoint function to be a struct with Set functions (reduce string manipulation/interpolation)
- [ ] Improve way we extract ProjectKey, Repository, etc
- [ ] Clean up prompt handling

## Future Goal
- [ ] Optimize loading time by partial configuration initialization so that each endpoint only queries for what it needs
- [ ] Create cross-platform build files (Makefile)
- [ ] Package for Homebrew
